This is a form of the libosdp code, edited for the Arduino. Having said
that, this code is likely too large for a ATMEGA328P. I have been working on
a STM32F030R8, in the form of a Nucleo64 Board. 

I hooked up the MAX232 to D2/D3/D8, which allowed debugging on the other
serial port. 

The LibOSDP library copies parts of the following codebases:
	* https://github.com/goToMain/libosdp
	* https://github.com/goToMain/c-utils/

It also uses the TinyAES library from libosdp.

There are numerous changes to make this fit into the Arduino structure,
including leveling out the directory structure and including files from
c-utils into this code base.

Eventually I might physically fork things at a later date, but may not. I
need to do more work for replacing numerous #defines.

I have not even looked at osdp_cp.c. Numerous changes are likely needed

There are two parts to this:
	* Arduino .INO program
	* Arduino LibOSDP Library

These live in the following respositories respectively:
	* https://github.com/vk2tds/libosdp_pd
	* https://github.com/vk2tds/libosdp_arduino
